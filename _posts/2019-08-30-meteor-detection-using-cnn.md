This paper describes an application of a pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural
Network to detect meteors from night sky images. The dataset is relatively small, composed
of labeled images of meteors and non-meteors from the night sky. Techniques like data
augmentation were used to create data artificially, and a dropout layer was introduced to prevent
overfitting at the training augmented dataset. The performance obtained by the methods using
traditional five-fold cross-validation along with changing of the images for black and white,
compared with the ones obtained using only the training and validation partitions and RGB
colors, achieved a higher mean accuracy of 84.35%.
